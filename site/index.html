        <h1>This is a 1MB website.</h1>
        <p><em>The web development community was missing a size reference. This site is that reference&mdash;the <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/mass/ipk/">International Prototype of the Kilogram</a>, but for web.</em></p>
        <p>The transfer size of this website is precisely 1MB. That means that the amount of data that actually needs to be transferred to the browser is 1MB.
        It's worth going into more detail about this because the fine details are important. 
        First off, 1MB is 1,048,576 bytes (1024<sup>2</sup> or 20<sup>20</sup> bytes),
        per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte">standard definition</a>. The exact resources that constitute a web
        page are not fixed, since clients are not obliged to fetch all of them. In this case the 1MB transfer size is reached if the browser
        downloads all linked images, JavaScript, CSS and the site's favicon (as the vast majority of browsers do). The 1MB transfer
        size includes the size of the response headers from the web server in its totals, since these are part of the cost of fetching a page.</p>
        <p>If your web test tool reports anything other than exactly 1MB as the size of this page it is incorrect, or is measuring
        something a little different. There are some valid reasons for a difference of opinion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some tools don't include the response headers in their page size totals. This will affect the total measured size, but not by much since each response
            header is only about 300 bytes in size, a tiny percentage (0.03%) of the total page weight</li>
            <li>Tools may leave out certain page resources e.g. JavaScript or the favicon (this is arguably incorrect since it is not how
            most browsers behave).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also some common but less justifiable reasons where page weight tools make mistakes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some tools report the uncompressed size of fetched assets. This doesn't make sense since the <em>cost</em> to a user of fetching an asset
            (in both time and data impact) is a factor of the <em>transfer size</em> of the resource, not the uncompressed size on disk once fetched. </li>
            <li>Simple under-counting and over-counting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
        <p>The page is served using HTTP 1.1. HTML, JavaScript and CSS resources are gziped before transfer, JPEG images are not. This is standard practice.</p>
        <p>This page uses a fairly typical mix of HTML, CSS, images and JavaScript. There are no <em>tricky</em> aspects designed to confuse/test
        tools. User agent request headers are not included in the 1MB total because this component of the page total is more decided by the browser rather than the server. </p>
        <p>No AJAX requests are utilised.</p>
